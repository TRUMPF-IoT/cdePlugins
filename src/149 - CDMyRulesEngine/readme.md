The Rules Engine allows users to define rules on certain events such as property changes or incoming messages and trigger actions like changing a property or sending a message.

You can find a detailed documentation on [the rules engine here](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeDocs/tree/master/docs/plugins/149-RulesEngine.md).
