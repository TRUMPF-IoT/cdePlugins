## CDMyNetwork Plugin

This plugin can monitor services on the network. 
In the initial version the plugin only supports ping but since the plugin is very simple it can easily be extended to monitor other services.

We will add more network service monitoring overtime such as TelNet, Unifi and others.

You can find a detailed documentation on [the Network Status Plugin here](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeDocs/tree/master/docs/plugins/093-NetworkStatus.md).
